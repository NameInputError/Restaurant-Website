		<h2>Law Flaw Causes Bob's New Job</h2>
		<p>Hi, I'm Bob, owner of Bob Loblaw's Lobster Bar and BBQ. Just three years ago I was
		a successful trial lawyer, working day and night on high profile cases. While I was grateful
		for the opportunites afforded me, I slowly came to terms with the fact that I just wasn't happy with
		with my job anymore. It had always been a backburner dream of mine to open a restaurant. But what possible chance
		did I, a lawyer with no actual experience running a business, have in such a competitive industry? Where was 
		my advantage?</p>
		<p>While sitting in my office one day researching a topic for my law blog, I came across a few odd statutes 
		regarding commercial sales on riverboat property. After a quick discussion with a colleague of mine who specialized in maritime law
		(he prefers the term "pirate lawyer"), I discovered that several taxes and product restrictions didn't apply to the 
		proper riverboat equipment in certain channels on the Mississippi. I had found my niche!</p>
		<p>I immediately seized the the opportunity, though not without trepidation. In the early days I found myself thinking "I've 
		made a huge mistake." Business was slow at first. But, as word about our top-quality lobster and one-of-a-kind exotic entrees 
		got around, Bob Loblaw's Lobster Bar and BBQ quickly grew into a popular and profitable establishment. Here at Bob's, we're 
		proud to combine the most exquisite food with the best legal advice you can order off a restaurant menu. We hope you'll give 
		us a try tonight!</p>
