		<h2>Bob Loblaw's: Where delicious food meets quality legal expertise!</h2>
		<p>The brainchild of a former trial lawyer, Bob Loblaw's Lobster Bar and BBQ aims to combine
		the finest exotic cuisine with the best legal services money can buy. We are located on a floating barge on the Mississippi,
		providing a charming bog-like atmosphere for our customers, and distinct legal advantages
		for our ownership. We serve only the finest lobster and exotic meats, ranging from our signature
		"Bob's Gob's of Lobster Blobs," to one-of-a-kind entrees like our "Legal Eagle." Our after-dinner
		specials include free consultation for anyone injured in an accident on public property, or by 
		something you did on purpose. Or try one of our fine desserts, like the delectable "Non-liable Homicide by 
		Chocolate."
		</p>
		<h3>Approach the Bar!</h3>
		<p>Before you sit down for dinner, sit down for drinks! Bob's Bar is home to some of the most popular
		in-house drink specials this side of the Mississippi. Start the night off with our 
		signature "Fuzzy Gavel," or try our popular "Consensual Relations on Publicly Owned Beach
		Property." Let Bob's renowned bartenders start your night off the way every good night begins:
		with lots of alcohol!<br><br>
		<i>Free DWI consultation available with purchase of 5 or more drinks.</i>
		</p>
		<h3>Available for Takeout</h3>
		<p>While many of our exotic entrees are legally required to be consumed on the premises,
		we have a limited menu available for takeout. <a href="menu.html">View our takeout menu</a> and order 
		here.
		<br><br>*Takeout purchases of Legal Eagle require a contract signature, as we are technically 
		selling a "pet."
